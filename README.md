# Call for Bioinformatics Internship at *icipe* Cohort 4

## Background
The demand for well-trained Bioinformaticians to support genomics research continues to rise. The Bioinformatics internship program at icipe seeks to attract highly motivated graduates for a three-month internship and mentorship. The interns undergo intensive training within the first month, after which they will be attached to ongoing genomic initiatives for a mini-project. The mini-project will provide hands-on experience and guarantee knowledge and skills retention. To instil continued self-learning, they will be assigned free online courses compiled to suit their training needs. For example, an intern interested in a computational Biology track will be guided to train on Python, R, UNIX, and other programming languages, undertaken in parallel with the mini-project.
